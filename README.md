# Powersave

This is a fork of <https://github.com/Unia/Powersave> which was based on the
thread from <http://crunchbanglinux.org/forums/topic/11954>.

For more informations on the udev rule disabling the polling, see also
<http://cgit.freedesktop.org/udisks/commit/?id=fb86ef144bad470b3d8ed761c7bdbe94886e5edd>.

For a version integrated closely with systemd, see
<https://github.com/intelfx/power-management>.

To put everything into udev rules (so that the powersave config is always
enabled), see <https://github.com/vodik/powersave/> or the `edge` branch of
<https://github.com/Unia/Powersave>.
